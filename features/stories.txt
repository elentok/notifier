- As a user I want to see messages sent to me 
  so I can deal with them
- As a user I want to mark a message as read 
  so I won't read it twice
- As a user I want to delete a message
  so I won't have too many messages in the inbox
- As a user I want to be notified when I receive a message
  so I can react to it as fast as possible
- As an application I want to send a message to a group of users
  so I can notify them on updates
